<p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS </strong> </p>
<p><strong>By participating in the Dell  PartnerDirect Program for ISVs (&ldquo;Program&rdquo;), the company or entity submitting  the Partner application (&ldquo;you&rdquo;) agrees to be bound by all of the Terms and  Conditions below (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;).</strong> Please print a  copy of this Agreement for your records. Completion of the partner application  does not imply that you have been accepted into the Program. Acceptance into  the PartnerDirect Program for ISVs does not imply that you have been accepted  into any other Dell PartnerDirect Programs, each of which may have separate  terms and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>1. ELIGIBILITY.</strong> Throughout your  participation in the Program, you (a) must be in compliance with any applicable  agreement with Dell currently in place, including but not limited to a signed,  written ISV Certified Partner Agreement (if applicable); (b) maintain a current  registration profile including yearly updates and prompt notification to Dell  in writing of any change that may affect your membership or membership level;  and (c) meet other criteria required by Dell. This Program is not exclusive,  and Dell may authorize any qualified third party to participate in the Program.</p>
<p> <strong>2. PARTNER PORTAL  ACCESS. </strong>Your use of the Partner Portal is subject to this Agreement,  Dell&rsquo;s Site Terms at <a href="http://www.dell.com/">www.dell.com</a>, and any  additional terms within the Partner Portal. You will create an online password  that will allow you to access the Partner Portal. You are responsible for  keeping your password confidential. Dell recommends that you change your  password regularly. You will be responsible for all activity on your account.  If you believe an unauthorized transaction has occurred in your account, please  notify the Dell ISV program office at <a href="mailto:US_partner_registration@dell.com">US_partner_registration@dell.com</a>.  You will not grant any third-party access to the Partner Portal without prior  written approval by Dell.</p>
<p><strong>3. PARTNER LISTING. </strong>Dell  may have a partner-locator tool to help the public search for a Dell partner.  Unless you advise Dell in writing that it may not do so, Dell may include you  in the partner-locator tool, which may include basic information such as your  company name, address, telephone number, web address, partnership level,  certified practice areas, and individual contact names.</p>
<p><strong>4. ERRORS &amp;  AVAILABILITY. </strong>Dell is not responsible for any  errors in transmission that may occur prior to our receipt of the transmission.  You acknowledge that the security procedures used in the Partner Portal are for  the purposes of authentication of a transmission, and not to detect error. In  addition, there may be a delay between the time you send a transmission to Dell  and the time Dell receives it. All transmissions are considered received by  Dell only when actually received by Dell. Dell is not responsible for any  delays between the time you send a transmission and the time Dell receives it.  Access to the Partner Portal may be unavailable without notice at certain  times, including when systems require maintenance or upgrades, or in the case  of unforeseen circumstances such as earthquakes, fires, floods, terrorism, war,  riot, computer virus or bugs, computer failures, interruptions in telephone  service, or electrical outages. Dell will not be liable for the unavailability of  service or for any damages that may result from such unavailability.</p>
<p><strong>5. CONFIDENTIALITY. </strong>The term &ldquo;Dell Confidential  Information&rdquo; means any information related to the Program, including the  Partner Portal and all non-public data contained in the Partner Portal. You  will keep all Dell Confidential Information strictly confidential for a period  of three (3) years after the termination of this Agreement or any related  agreement with Dell. You may not disclose Dell Confidential Information to any  third party without Dell&rsquo;s prior written consent. You may share Dell  Confidential Information with only your employees who have a need to know and  who are subject to legally binding obligations to keep such information  confidential. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to any Dell  Confidential Information that (a) you can demonstrate was in your possession  before receipt from Dell; (b) is or becomes publicly available through no fault  by you; or (c) you rightfully received from a third party without a duty of  confidentiality. If you are required by a government body or court of law to  disclose any Dell Confidential Information, you agree to give Dell reasonable  advance notice so that Dell may contest the disclosure or seek a protective  order.</p>
<p><strong>6. ADMINISTRATION</strong>.  At any time Dell may audit your compliance with the Program or verify any  reports or claims you submitted. Dell may deny any claim that it believes, in  its sole discretion, does not conform to Program rules, which include this  Agreement. Dell may, without prior notice, immediately suspend or terminate  your participation in the Program if you submit inaccurate, incomplete, or  fraudulent claims or information or if you engage in activities that may cause  damage, embarrassment or adverse publicity to Dell. Dell&rsquo;s records and systems  shall be authoritative and conclusive for purposes of determining your  eligibility and Program benefits and for performing any computation under the  Program. Dell reserves the right to interpret the rules of the Program in its sole  discretion. All decisions made by Dell are final.</p>
